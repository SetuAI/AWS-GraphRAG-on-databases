STEPS 1 TO 3 OF THE AGENT
-------------------------
    guard_input      A Bedrock Guardrail checks the question for prompt attacks.
    understand       The small model works out what is being asked: the
                     names in it, the dates, which approved metrics apply,
                     and, for a follow-up, the full question it stands for.
    match_entities   Each name is matched to an exact database value through
                     pgvector ("sahyadri credit fund" -> "Sahyadri Credit Risk Fund").

Each step receives the agent's state (a dict) and returns only the fields
it changes. LangGraph merges those into the state for the next step.

                         "data_change" -> asks to delete, update, insert, create, drop or otherwise change data
                         "off_topic"   -> not about this company's data at all
  "standalone_question": the question rewritten to make sense on its own. If it is a follow-up
                         (e.g. "now only debt funds"), combine it with the previous question.
  "intent":              one sentence: what the user wants to know
  "entities":            names of specific things in the question, as a list of
                         {"text": the name as written, "kind": one of scheme, issuer, group, sector,
                         distributor, manager, category, city, benchmark}. Empty list if none.
  "time_range":          {"start": "YYYY-MM-DD", "end": "YYYY-MM-DD"} or null if no period is implied
  "metrics":             names from the approved metrics list that this question needs (may be empty)
  "needs_clarification": true ONLY if the question is impossible to answer as written, for example it
                         refers to "that fund" with no previous question to say which. Otherwise false.
  "clarification_question": the question to ask back, or null

Rules:
- "Why did X happen?" questions ARE answerable: answer with the data around the event (the figures
  for that period and the ones before it, and related activity such as redemptions). Do not ask for
  clarification because the cause cannot be proven; the commentary will describe timing, not cause.
- When a name or period is broad, assume the reasonable reading instead of asking.
- The data covers {start} to {end}. Treat "latest", "now" and "this month" as {end}, and
  "last month", "last year" relative to {end}."""
