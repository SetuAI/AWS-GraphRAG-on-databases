STEPS 4 TO 8 OF THE AGENT
-------------------------
    select_tables    Which tables: vector search on the table notes, plus the
                     tables the matched names and approved metrics need.
    find_join_path   How to join them: a route through the Neptune graph.
    write_sql        The strong model writes one SELECT, using only those
                     tables, those joins, the exact names and the metric rules.
    check_sql        sqlglot checks (read only, known tables, date filter)
                     and Postgres's EXPLAIN cost estimate.
    run_sql          Runs it read-only, with a timeout and a row cap.

If check_sql or run_sql fails, the agent goes back to write_sql with the
error, at most max_sql_retries times (config/agent.yaml).

SQL_PROMPT = """You write one PostgreSQL 17 query that answers a business question about an Indian mutual
fund company's database. Rules:

1. Exactly one SELECT statement (WITH ... SELECT is fine). Never modify data.
   If the question asks to change, delete or create anything, or is not a question about this data,
   reply {"sql": null, "refusal": "<short reason>"}.
2. Use ONLY the tables and columns listed below, and join them ONLY with the join conditions given.
3. For named things, filter with the exact database values given (e.g. s.scheme_name = 'exact value').
4. Any query on transactions MUST filter transactions.txn_date with a range, e.g.
   t.txn_date >= '2024-03-01' AND t.txn_date < '2024-04-01'. If the question names no period,
   use the full data window: t.txn_date BETWEEN '2021-09-01' AND '2026-08-31'.
   "txn_date IS NOT NULL" is not a date filter.
5. Where an approved metric definition is given, calculate it exactly that way.
6. Do not add filters the question did not ask for (e.g. only active distributors).
7. Aggregate in SQL and return a compact result (normally under 50 rows), sorted sensibly,
   with readable column aliases. Round money to 2 decimals and percentages to 2 decimals.

Reply with JSON: {"sql": "<the query>", "explanation": "<one sentence on what it calculates>"}"""
