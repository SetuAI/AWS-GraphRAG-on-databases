WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR
---------------------
Wires the 11 steps into ONE LangGraph workflow with a fixed order
(tradeoff 10), and runs a question through it.

    from agent.graph import ask
    result = ask("Why did net flows in Sahyadri Credit Risk Fund drop in March 2024?", "conv-1")

THE ROUTE THROUGH THE STEPS
---------------------------
    guard_input ──attack──────────────────────────────────────────→ END (blocked)
        ↓
    understand ──change data / off topic─────────────────────────→ END (blocked)
               ──needs clarification──────────────────────────────→ END
        ↓
    match_entities → select_tables → find_join_path → write_sql ──refused──→ END (blocked)
                                                         ↑   ↓
                                   fail, retries left ───┤  check_sql ──fail, no retries──→ END (failed)
                                                         │   ↓
                                   fail, retries left ───┘  run_sql ──fail, no retries───→ END (failed)
                                                             ↓
                                   summarise → write_commentary → remember → END (completed)

TRACING
-------
Every step is wrapped by _traced(), which:
    - times the step, and adds a line to state["steps"] (shown on the demo page)
    - opens an OpenTelemetry span, which Application Insights receives
      (api/telemetry.py switches that on)
LangSmith needs no code here: with LANGSMITH_TRACING=true in .env,
LangGraph sends every step to LangSmith by itself.

MEMORY
------
InMemorySaver keeps each conversation's state between questions, keyed by
conversation_id ("thread_id" in LangGraph). That is what makes follow-up
questions work. It lives in the server's memory, so it is lost on restart;
Stage 8 replaces it with a Postgres-backed saver.
