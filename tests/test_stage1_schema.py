tests/test_stage1_schema.py
===========================

WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR
---------------------
Checks that apply_schema.py built the mf_data schema on Amazon RDS exactly
as designed. These tests are Stage 1's "done when" list, written as code:

    1. All 20 tables exist, with the right names.
    2. transactions is split into exactly 60 monthly pieces.
    3. The 3 hidden links have NO foreign key (they must stay hidden).
    4. The declared links that the graph relies on DO exist.

WHY TEST THE SCHEMA AT ALL
--------------------------
Every later stage depends on it. If a table is missing, the generator fails.
If a hidden link was accidentally declared, Stage 5's link-finding score is
meaningless, because the "hidden" link would be found for free by reading
the declared foreign keys. These tests catch both kinds of mistake the
moment they happen, instead of weeks later.

HOW TO RUN
----------
After running apply_schema.py against RDS:
