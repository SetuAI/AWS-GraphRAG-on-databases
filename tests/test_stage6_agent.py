==========================

WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR
---------------------
Checks the agent end to end, on the questions the demo will ask.

    SQL CHECKS    (no AWS needed) the guardrail refuses anything that
                  writes, multi-statement tricks, unknown tables and
                  transactions queries without a date filter.

    DEMO QUESTIONS (calls Amazon Bedrock and the Bedrock Guardrail; ~2-4 minutes,
                  a few rupees) each demo question runs through the whole
                  agent and must finish with the right status and the right data.

HOW TO RUN
----------
    pytest tests/test_stage6_agent.py -v              # everything
    pytest tests/test_stage6_agent.py -v -k checks    # only the quick offline checks

A failing demo question is a rehearsal finding, not a crash: read the SQL
in the failure message, and tell me what it did.
