tests/test_stage2_data.py
=========================

WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR
---------------------
Checks the data the generator loaded into mf_data. Two kinds of checks:

    VALIDATION  -> the data is internally correct: no broken links, no
                   impossible values, and the summary tables agree with
                   the transactions they were calculated from.

    PATTERNS    -> each of the 6 planted patterns is actually visible in
                   the data, so the demo questions have something to find.

This is Gate 1 from the build plan: nothing moves to Azure until every
check here passes.

HOW TO RUN
----------
After running the generator:
