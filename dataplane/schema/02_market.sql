-- WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR
-- ---------------------
-- Creates the 6 "market" tables. These describe what the schemes invest in:
-- the companies (issuers), the shares and bonds they issue (securities), the
-- credit ratings of those bonds over time, and how much of each security
-- every scheme holds at each month end.
--
--   1. sectors                -> industry of a company (Banking, Power, ...)
--   2. issuer_groups          -> business group a company belongs to
--   3. issuers                -> the companies and governments that issue securities
--   4. securities             -> individual shares, bonds, commercial paper, ...
--   5. credit_rating_history  -> rating changes on each security over time (OLD-STYLE NAMES)
--   6. portfolio_holdings     -> what each scheme holds at each month end
--
-- WHERE THIS FITS
-- ---------------
-- File 2 of 4. Must run after 01_fund_house.sql, because portfolio_holdings
-- points to schemes, which is created in file 01.
--
-- These tables make the multi-hop questions possible, which are the ones the
-- graph exists for. For example: "Which schemes hold bonds that were
-- downgraded?" needs the route
--     schemes -> portfolio_holdings -> securities -> credit_rating_history
-- On AWS that route is stored in Amazon Neptune, so the model does not have to
-- guess how these tables connect. The route itself is worked out from the
-- links below, plus the undeclared ones the pipeline discovers.
