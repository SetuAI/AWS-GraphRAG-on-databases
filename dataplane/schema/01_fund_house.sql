-- WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR
-- ---------------------
-- Creates the 9 "fund house" tables. These describe the mutual fund company's
-- own products: which schemes it runs, the plans inside each scheme, who
-- manages them, what they are compared against, and their daily prices.
--
--   1. scheme_categories           -> the SEBI category of a scheme (Large Cap, Liquid, ...)
--   2. benchmarks                  -> the index a scheme is compared against (e.g. a Nifty-style index)
--   3. benchmark_values            -> the daily value of each benchmark
--   4. schemes                     -> the funds themselves
--   5. scheme_plans                -> Direct/Regular x Growth/IDCW versions of each scheme
--   6. fund_managers               -> the people who manage schemes
--   7. scheme_manager_assignments  -> who managed which scheme, and when
--   8. nav_history                 -> the daily price (NAV) of each plan
--   9. scheme_aum_monthly          -> total money managed per scheme, per month end
--
-- WHERE THIS FITS
-- ---------------
-- This is file 1 of 4. apply_schema.py runs them in order 01 -> 04, because
-- later files point to tables created here (for example, portfolio_holdings in
-- file 02 points to schemes, which is created in this file).
--
-- WHERE IT RUNS (AWS)
-- -------------------
-- These tables are created in mf_data, one of the two databases on the
-- Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL instance:
--
--   mf_data     -> the fund data (these 20 tables). Stands in for the client's
--                  own database. The agent only ever READS it.
--   agent_meta  -> the agent's own data: table notes, links and the pgvector
--                  embeddings. The agent reads and writes it.
--
-- Nothing here needs an extension. pgvector is switched on in agent_meta only,
-- and the schema graph lives in Amazon Neptune, not in Postgres: RDS does not
-- offer Apache AGE, which is the one design change from the Azure build.
--
-- A NOTE ON THE COMMENTS IN THIS FILE
-- -----------------------------------
-- Comments starting with "--" live only in this file. They are NOT stored in
-- the database. That matters: in Stage 5 our pipeline reads the database to
-- write its own notes about each table, exactly as it will on the client's
-- database. If we stored descriptions in the database, the pipeline would be
-- copying our answers instead of working them out, and its score would mean
-- nothing.

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- CLEAN START
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- While building, we will run this file many times. These lines delete the
-- tables if they already exist, so each run starts from empty.
--
-- IF EXISTS -> do not fail on the very first run, when the tables do not exist yet.
-- CASCADE   -> also remove anything in other files that points at these tables
--              (for example, the link from portfolio_holdings to schemes).
--              Those other files recreate their own tables and links anyway.
--
-- This is safe ONLY because mf_data holds synthetic data that this project
-- generates. Never point apply_schema.py at an RDS instance holding real data:
-- the client deletes the whole dataplane/ folder and keeps their own database.
