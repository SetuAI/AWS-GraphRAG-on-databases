WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR
---------------------
Asks the strong model (gpt-5.1) to draft a plain-English note for each table
and each of its columns. This is tradeoff 3.

These notes are what the SQL-writing model reads in Stage 6 to decide which
tables and columns to use. A good note is the difference between the model
guessing what "rtg_dt" means and knowing it is the date a rating was given.

WHAT THE MODEL IS SHOWN, PER TABLE
----------------------------------
    - table name and estimated row count
    - each column's name, type, null rate and number of distinct values
    - a few example values per column, EXCEPT for PII columns (config/pii.yaml)
    - the links to and from this table (declared and proposed)

WHAT THE MODEL IS NEVER SHOWN
-----------------------------
    - values from PII columns
    - the answer key, or anything about planted patterns

WHAT COMES BACK
---------------
A JSON object: a description of the table, what one row represents (its
"grain"), a short list of business terms, and one description per column.
Everything is saved as 'draft' until a human approves it in review.py.

Write plainly and precisely. Column names may be abbreviated or cryptic: work out their meaning from
the name, type, example values and links, and say what they mean in full. Mention units (rupees,
percent, count) and what empty values mean where it matters. Do not invent columns or values.

Reply with a JSON object with exactly these keys:
